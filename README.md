## Introduction

Bullying, in forms of verbal abuse, physical abuse or tall poppy syndrome is now extremely common amongst teens in schools or public places and has now increased due to the form of cyberbullying taking place. A survey conducted by the National Centre Against Bullying (NCAB) found 1 in 4 Australian students have reported being bullied. Imagine the amount of other kids who have stayed silent through their teenage years.

Unfortunately, issues like these are not being properly raised and talked about.

### Technologies

#### EJS
EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a JavaScript templating engine widely used in web development to create dynamic web pages and applications. It functions similar to HTML but allows seamless integration of JavaScript code within HTML, enabling the creation of more dynamic and fluent web applications.

EJS also supports the use of partials, which allows developers to nest `.ejs` files to create reusable components that assemble into complete HTML files at runtime. Unlike React, EJS is more user-friendly as it follows the HTML syntax and is lightweight. In this project, EJS was mainly used for the navigation bar, reducing code duplication and separate rendering on each page.

#### Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables JavaScript to run outside the web development environment, powering server-side, mobile apps, and non-web applications with JavaScript.

JavaScript is essential in a web developer's toolkit, mainly due to its Node Package Manager (NPM), which allows installation of community-built packages such as Express.js or EJS, adding additional functionality. Node.js is considered one of the most significant projects in JavaScript development history.

Major organizations like Netflix, NASA, Trello, PayPal, LinkedIn, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, eBay, GoDaddy, and Citibank utilize Node.js for its versatility and efficiency.

#### Express.js
Express.js, commonly referred to as Express, is a versatile framework for Node.js that simplifies the web development process. It provides developers with a powerful API that simplifies complex tasks like routing, logging, authentication, and handling HTTP requests.

Companies like Twitter and Trustpilot include Express.js in their tech stack due to its versatility. In this project, Express was used for routing, allowing the setup of different routes for various pages in a secure and modern way without the need for the `.html` extension.

#### GitHub
GitHub is a centralized version control, code management, and hosting platform that facilitates collaboration on software projects and tracks changes to codebases. It utilizes Git, an open-source version control system that links the developer's local repository with the cloud-based repository on GitHub.

GitHub also serves as a social platform where developers can share their coding journey and showcase their activity, which interests companies in search of hiring opportunities. Among the tens of thousands of companies that use GitHub in their tech stack, popular ones include Netflix, Airbnb, Shopify, Udemy, and Reddit.

In this project, GitHub was used for collaboration, change tracking, and documentation.

#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an open-source IDE (Integrated Development Environment) created by Microsoft. It is a lightweight version of Microsoft Visual Studio. While Visual Studio Code lacks low-level programming capabilities for languages like C++ or Assembly, it is well-suited for web development.

Developers benefit from its simple user interface, shortcuts, and extensions. Visual Studio Code is widely used in the industry by companies like Google and is also popular in many universities.

### Explanation[^1]

#### ./src/index.js
The `index.js` code sets up a web server using the Express.js framework, applies security and performance enhancements, and defines routes for different pages.

The code imports the necessary modules: express, helmet, and compression.
- These modules are required for creating the web server, enhancing security, and improving performance.

The code initializes an instance of the Express application by calling `express()`.
- The created instance is assigned to the variable app.

The code sets the view engine to EJS (Embedded JavaScript) using `app.set("view engine", "ejs")`.
- It specifies the directory where the EJS views are located by setting `app.set("views", "./src/views")`.

The code uses express.static middleware to serve static files (such as CSS, images) from the "public" directory.
- The `__dirname` variable represents the current directory.

The code applies the Helmet middleware using `app.use(helmet())`.
- Helmet is a collection of security-related middleware functions that enhance the security of the web application.
- It helps protect the application from various attacks and vulnerabilities.
- The code also disables the "x-powered-by" header using `app.disable("x-powered-by")`.
- Disabling this header removes server information from the response, providing an additional layer of security.

The code applies the Compression middleware using `app.use(compression())`.
- Compression is a middleware that enables gzip compression for the responses sent by the server.
- This helps reduce the size of the responses and improves the overall performance of the web application.

The code defines routes for different pages using `app.get()`.
- For example, when a GET request is made to the root URL ("/"), the server renders the "index" template using `res.render("index")`.
- Similarly, when requests are made to `"/aboutUs"`, `"/mission"`, and `"/events"`, the corresponding EJS templates are rendered.

The code starts the server and makes it listen on port 3001 using `app.listen(3001)`.
- This means the web application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.

#### ./src/views/index.ejs
The `index.ejs` file represents the home page of the Bullying Wiki website. It provides the HTML structure and content for the home page, including the page title, favicon, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript file references. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `head` section includes necessary metadata, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
- The `include` statement `./partials/nav.ejs` includes the navigation component in the page.
- External resources, such as the website logo and CSS stylesheets, are linked using the `link` tags.
- The `body` section contains the main content of the home page.
- The `fold` div represents the top section of the page, which displays the website name "Bullying.wiki" and a tagline about creating a safer web.
- The `bullying-definition` div provides a definition of bullying, including its pronunciation and a description of its meaning.
- The `our-mission-button-container` div contains a button with a link to the "Our Mission" page.
- The `image-container` div displays an image related to statistics.
- Following the `body` section, there are additional div elements representing different sections of the page, including hooks to engage the reader and provide information on how to help stop cyberbullying.
- Finally, the `script` tag references a JavaScript file named "nav.js" for any additional functionality related to navigation.

This structure and content work together to create the visual and interactive elements of the Bullying Wiki home page, providing visitors with information about bullying and ways to combat it.

#### ./src/views/aboutUs.ejs

The `aboutUs.ejs` file represents the "About Us" page of the Bullying Wiki website. It provides the HTML structure and content for the page, including the page title, favicon, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript file references. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `head` section includes necessary metadata, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
- External resources, such as the website logo and CSS stylesheets, are linked using the `link` tags.
- The `body` section contains the main content of the "About Us" page.
- The `include` statement `./partials/nav.ejs` includes the navigation component in the page.
- The `p` element contains paragraphs of text that describe the purpose and mission of the Bullying Wiki website.
- Within the paragraphs, there are several `div` elements representing items related to cyberbullying, such as understanding cyberbullying, prevention strategies, victim support, bystander intervention, and legislation and reporting.
- Each of these items is structured as a `div` element with a number and a corresponding description.

#### ./src/views/events.ejs

As of right now, it includes nothing useful but it currently has

- A `head` section which includes necessary metadata, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
- External resources, such as the website logo and CSS stylesheets, are linked using the `link` tags.
- The `body` section which contains the main content of the "Events" page.
- The `include` statement `./partials/nav.ejs` which includes the navigation component in the page.

#### ./src/views/mission.ejs

Same as `events.ejs`, it doesn't have anything useful, but as of right now has the same components as `events.ejs` with a bit of text.

### The Future

For the rest of the term I would love to get this website finished to have a site that clearly emphazises the problem of bullying and how to combat it.

I want the main page to be filled with a lot more content. What I have now is a starting point and an idea of what I am envisioning.

I plan to host the site by the end of the term with my Raspberry Pi, using Cloudflare Tunnels to securely host it to the internet without needing to open ports on my router.

The site should hopefully be indexed high on Google so people can access and view the website, I may need to look into SEO if it is low in Google results, but I shall see what happens.
