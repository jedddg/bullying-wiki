## Introduction

Bullying, in forms of verbal abuse, physical abuse or tall poppy syndrome is now extremely common amongst teens in schools or public places and has now increased due to the form of cyberbullying taking place. A survey conducted by the National Centre Against Bullying (NCAB) found 1 in 4 Australian students have reported being bullied. Imagine the amount of other kids who have stayed silent through their teenage years.

Unfortunately, issues like these are not being properly raised.
